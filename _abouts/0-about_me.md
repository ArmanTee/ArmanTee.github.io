### About Me…

Hi, I’m Arman.

<div class="imgcontainer col-xs-12 col-sm-4 col-md-3 col-lg-3" style="width:250px;padding:0em 1em 0em 0em"> <p><img src="/assets/img/arman.jpg" alt="arman" class="pull-left img-responsive thumb img-thumbnail"></p> </div>

I’m a kdb developer currently based in London. I graduated with a Masters in Physics and have been working in the banking industry ever since. I’m interested in all things science and mathematics. I like coding, especially to demonstrate statistical phenomena. Outside of that I love swimming, running, travelling, politics, philosophy and debating ideas.

YNWA.

Thanks for stopping by!
